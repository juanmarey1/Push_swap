# Stack Sorter Algorithm in C

This project implements an algorithm to **sort a stack using a predefined set of movements** with the **least number of moves possible**, built with **C** and a **Makefile**.

It demonstrates:

- Algorithm optimization  
- Stack operations  
- Efficient sorting logic

## ðŸ›  Installation

Use the included **Makefile** to build and manage the project:

```bash
make        # Build all object files and executable
make run    # Build executable and clean object files
make clean  # Remove object files
make fclean # Remove objects and executable
make re     # Clean + build fresh executable
```
---
## ðŸš€ Usage

Run the program with:

```bash
./push_swap "n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 ..."
```
or 
```bash
./push_swap n1 n2 n3 n4 ...
```
